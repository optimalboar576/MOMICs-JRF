		<h1>HOW THE DATA CAN BE USED?</h1>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
		 Genome annotation is the process of identifying functional elements along the sequence of a genome, thus giving meaning to it. It is necessary because the sequencing of DNA produces sequences of unknown function. Genome annotation consists of describing the function of the product of a predicted gene. Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment analysis is ubiquitously used for interpreting high throughput molecular data and generating hypotheses about underlying biological phenomena of experiments. However, the two building blocks of this analysis -the ontology and the annotations evolve rapidly. Ontologies provide a uniform vocabulary for representing domain knowledge. The Gene Ontology (GO) is the most widely used ontology for specifying cellular location, molecular function, and biological process. The GO annotation is the list of all annotated genes linked to ontology terms describing those genes. The GO annotation documents all evidence that led to the association of a gene and a GO term. These annotation data or ontology data can be used by biologists and researchers for better understanding location, function and process of gene products.
