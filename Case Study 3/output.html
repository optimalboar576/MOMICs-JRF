		<h1>OUTCOMES AND INTERPRETATIONS</h1>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
Different outcomes were found in different tools. As it is a pipeline, the output from the first program is used as input in the next program. 
The input was a FASTA sequence of the whole genome in GeneMark. As result predicted genes were found (a total of 4793; in both positive and 
negative strands). Randomly 10 genes were selected for annotation. The genes were saved in one FASTA file. The main annotation tool was Blast2GO.
There are different other methods for gene annotation. Omicsbox has all of it together in one tool. Omicsbox uses Blast, InterPro Scan and Blast2GO
altogether for better annotation in a structured format. The final outcome of the annotation is saved in an excel file “Ecoli_annotation.xlsx”. The
table contained annotation data from Blast (E-value); Interpro scan (Interpro ID,InterPro GO IDs & InterPro GO names). Blast2GO mapping and annotation
gives the GO IDs, GO names, Enzyme codes, Enzyme names. The GO IDs have prefixes F, P and C; these three represents Function, Process and Component 
respectively. Theses GO IDs can be accessed in EMBL-EBI Quick-GO. Gene Ontology (GO) is representation of gene and gene product. As representation of 
outcome one gene ontology for each predicted gene is represented using EMBL-EBI Quick-GO.

1.Gene_3: P:GO:0007165 – This gene product is associated with signal transduction. The cellular process in which a signal is conveyed to trigger a 
change in the activity or state of a cell. Signal transduction begins with reception of a signal (e.g. a ligand binding to a receptor or receptor 
activation by a stimulus such as light), or for signal transduction in the absence of ligand, signal-withdrawal or the activity of a constitutively 
active receptor.

		<p style="font-family:verdana">
2.Gene_17: P:GO:0009234 – Involved in menaquinone biosynthetic process. The chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of any of the 
menaquinones. Structurally, menaquinones consist of a methylated naphthoquinone ring structure and side chains composed of a variable number of 
unsaturated isoprenoid residues. Menaquinones that have vitamin K activity and are known as vitamin K2.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
3.Gene_19: F:GO:0005198- Involved in the molecular function of structural molecule activity. The action of a molecule that contributes to the 
structural integrity of a complex or its assembly within or outside a cell.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
4.Gene_21: F:GO:0016887- The gene product has ATPase activity. Catalysis of the reaction: 
ATP + H2O = ADP + phosphate + 2 H+. May or may not be coupled to another reaction.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
5.Gene_22: F:GO:0005524- Its function is to bind to ATP. Interacting selectively and non-covalently with ATP, adenosine 5'-triphosphate, a universally 
important coenzyme and enzyme regulator.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
6.Gene_25: P:GO:0016226- Used in the biological process of iron-sulfer cluster assembly. The incorporation of iron and exogenous sulfur into a metallo
-sulfur cluster.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
7.Gene_27: C:GO:0019867- It is a cellular component of outer membrane. The external membrane of Gram-negative bacteria or certain organelles such as 
mitochondria and chloroplasts; freely permeable to most ions and metabolites.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
8.Gene_48: P:GO:0006313- Involved in the biological process of DNA-mediated transposition. Any process involved in a type of transpositional recombination 
which occurs via a DNA intermediate.
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
9.Gene_55: F:GO:0003677- The gene product binds to DNA. Any molecular function by which a gene product interacts selectively and non-covalently with DNA 
(deoxyribonucleic acid).
		</p>
		<p style="font-family:verdana">
10.Gene_57: P:GO:0019430- It’s involved in the biological process of removal of superoxide radicals. Any process, acting at the cellular level, involved 
in removing superoxide radicals (O2-) from a cell or organism, e.g. by conversion to dioxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2).
